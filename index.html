          The internet was left in an emotional state after watching a video of
          an artist's sketch that depicted the story of a young Indian Army
          soldier. Colonel DPK Pillay shared the video on Twitter and it is
          swiftly going viral on social media.

        <div>
          To narrate the story of a soldier, the artist made several sketches on
          a sheet of paper. The artwork has been made in such a manner that as
          she folds the paper, the scenes emerge in order to illustrate the
          story.

          It starts with a soldier embracing his mother before leaving home. As
          his mother bids him goodbye, he boards the bus. In the subsequent
          scene, the soldier lays down his life while his mother weeps. The
          story culminates into a man saluting the Indian Flag, and with the
          message, "Jai Hind!"
        </div>

        <div>
          So as to set the mood for the artwork, the artist used Akshay Kumar's
          song Naina Ashq Na Ho from his 2014 film Holiday: A Soldier Is Never
          Off Duty in the backdrop of the video.
